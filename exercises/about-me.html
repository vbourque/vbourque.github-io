   <h2>My Academics</h2>
   <p>I am a second semester junior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, looking forward to starting my next great adventure: a professional career! As an English major with minors in both Italian Studies and History, I have a strong background in the humanities, but my certificate in <a class="standard" href="http://www.umass.edu/pwtc/">Professional Communication and Technical Writing</a> has given me the opportunity to work with more logic-based technological fields.</p>

   <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
    
    <p>I have had a variety of jobs, from nanny to assistant-manager of a local violin store. While working in the store, I was able to develop professional communication and contract-writing skills, as well as learn how to handle demanding customers (something I also got to work on as a nanny). I've also had experience in more physical fields, working with advanced lighting and sound equipment in UMass's Fine Arts Center. You can see more about my previous work experience on my <a class="standard" href="resume.html">resume</a> or <a class="standard" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-bourque-362b18126/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
       
   <h2>My Outside Interests</h2>
   <p>I am currently the secretary for the UMass Gospel Choir and have been a member of the UMass Theatre Guild, either on and off stage, for every semester that I've attended UMass. At home, I write, play, and produce my own music, primarily for myself, using my voice, violin, keyboard, electric bass, and music production software, taking advantage of the skills I gained from being in a jazz and rock band before I started my college career.</p>
   <p>In my free time, I like to walk my three dogs, read (particularly Victorian literature), and watch mass quantities of British television shows, from <i>Broadchurch</i> to <i>8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.</i></p>
